<h1>Abdul Haseeb Portfolio</h1>

This is my first project - User Centric Frontend Development - <strong>Abdul Haseeb CV</strong> 

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding and implementation of the various subjects covered in the course so far. 

This is not meant to be a landing page for my curriculum vitae.

<h2>Demo</h2>
To view a live demo of the website project, please click <a href="https://ahaseeb235.github.io/Abdul-Haseeb-CV2"> here.</a> 

<h2>UX</h2>
The objective here is to have a single page layout with all the details, thereby, making it easily accesible for visitors on the site. 

Additionally, visitors can also download my CV and contact me directly. Visitors are prompted to contact me both at the start and at the end of the page.

Images are my own, and the combination of navy blue, steel blue, light gray and orange was used to create contrast and easy visibility across devices. 

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

1. HMTL
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap 3.3.7

<h2>Features</h2>
Scrollspy feature of Bootstrap has been used in the site. Navbar is fixed on top and collapses for view on devices with smaller screens, tablets and mobile phones. 

Inspiration for the design and scrollspy was taken from Ref <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_scrollspy&stacked=h"> here.</a>

<h4>Features for future Development</h4>
The possibilities are tremendous. I would have liked to include features such as:
1. Back to top arrow
2. Animations on progress bars/graphs
3. Videos showcasing my work and progress

<h2>Testing</h2>
The site was designed with "mobile first" user in mind. 

We jump in straight into "Why Hire Me" and skill section. There is a lot of room potential in this section, where I could showcase my skills in greater detail using 
enhanced visual aids such as progress circles and more detail on the respective skill level.

The Skills section is followed by the Work Experience section, which is followed by my portfolio to showcase some of the projects that I have worked on. I would have
liked to add more details on the projects for potential employers and recruiters. 

Contact buttons in the top of the page (modal popup) and a contact form at the bottom of the page is intended to prompt employers/recruiters to contact me without having
to move to any particular contacts section. They can also download my CV from the button made available in the navbar and in the jumbotron as well. 

Social media links and contact details are at the bottom of the page. 

All links are set to open in a new tab and the CV will download to your default browser or folder. All links are active. 

To ensure compatibility and responsiveness, the site was tested across multiple browsers including Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox. 
The site was also tested on multiple mobile devices including iPhone 5/6/7: Chrome and Safari; and Samsung Galaxy S5.S6,S7: Chrome and Samsung Internet Brower. 
Testing was also carried out to enure reponsiveness in both portrait and landscape view. 

Modal popup and contact form is not active. It needs further development. 

<h2>Deployment</h2>
To deploy the site, I have hosted it using Github pages, directly from the master branch. In accordance with the facility of updating the page, all updates will be 
automatically occur upon new commits being pushed. 



<h2>Credits</h2>

<h4>Content</h4>
All content on the website is written by me. 

<h4>Media</h4>
All images used in the website are my own, taken during walks or hikes using Samsung Galaxy S7 phone camera. Filters have been applied to adjust the images to match
the navbar. 

The logos in the portfolio section are actual logos representing existing or past businesses and projects that I have worked on in the past. These logos/images are
linked to live websites/webpages. I have NOT worked on these websites, but rather created the logos and print material. 

<h4>Acknowledgments</h4>

The code and structure is based on Bootstrap 3.3.7, and I have made changes to the html and css of the code.
